      The world is waiting to see your sweet smile in this beautiful morning. Wake up and bless this world with your charm for yet another day! 
      <strong> 
     </strong> Every morning I wake up thanking God for giving me one more day to prove my love for you. Good morning my princess! 
       <strong> A beautiful day is waiting outside your door. So, wake up and be a part of it. Your life will be full of love on this day. Good morning! 
       </strong>. You are the sunshine that fades all the darkness in my life. You are my road to redemption. I have never loved someone so deeply than you. I love you more than I can say. Nothing can ever change my love for you! 
        <strong> I never believed that any person other than God can give meaning to my empty life. But when I met you, I realized God had a special plan for me. He sent an angel in disguise of you to make my life beautiful. I love you! 
        </strong> Your sweet smile is my inspiration for starting every day with new hopes and dreams. Your sweet voice is the reason why my life is so peaceful. Thanks for coming into my life and making it more wonderful than ever. I owe you everything! 
        <strong> . Every moment I spend loving you is like the moments I spend in heaven. The day I will stop loving you is the day I die. I love you more than myself. keep up that sweet smile in your face always! 
         </strong> Love is not something that you can express in words. Love is something that is expressed by actions and felt with the heart. I donâ€™t know how much loved I make you feel but trust me, dear, you are the most precious thing in my life. I love you! 
          <strong> I never believed in true love until I met you. Since then, loving you has become the only truth in my life. My world is so dreamlike now and all I dream of is you! Only God can wake me up now! 
            <strong> and that is such an amazing gift to the world. 
            <strong> thank you so much
